# ReusableSystems
### Various systems to use in future projects!

So, I got bored of writing the same code over and over again when making new Unity projects. So instead, I'll just use the code I wrote and change it so I can transpose it to any projects! Here are the things I've done so far:


## Dialogue box

Probably one of my biggest system so far. You can write all of your dialogue in a single text file, and the ConversationManager and InputDecoder scripts will take care of the work. You can also write commands in the text file to trigger specific actions (such as showing a sprite/character, pausing dialogue for a given amount of time, or even triggering choices). Great if you're working with people working in narrative / storytelling and they don't know how to code very well!

## Inventory

A Minecraft/Terraria type of inventory that holds many slots. Number of slots can be changed and their positions will be adjusted automatically. You can move items by clicking them and place them in empty slots or exchanging places with another item. The four slots on the top represent equipment and armor (ie. head, chest, legs and feet) where only items with corresponding tags can be equipped (a sword can only be equipped in the weapons slot, for instance). You can make your own items using ScriptableObjects with their own tag and also make new tags entirely.
