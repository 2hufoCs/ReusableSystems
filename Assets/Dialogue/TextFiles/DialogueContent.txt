// This is the text file that contains all of the dialogue of the game.
// In order to write dialogues you must follow a few rules.
//
// A conversation is any scene from the moment where the dialogue box shows up to the moment it closes.
// To start a new conversation, write a line that begins with # and enter the name of the conversation.
// example: 
// # Conversation1
//
// Then, for each sentence (or group of sentences) that you want a character to say, put brackets at the beginning
// of the line. Inside them, insert the name of the character in uppercase and the name of the sprite to use in lowercase.
// Outside of the brackets, write the sentence you want them to say.
// example:
// [BOB sad] Oh such sadness in my heart
//
// If you only want to speak the protagonist's thoughts and not show a sprite, you can leave the brackets empty.
// Either way, brackets must be the first thing that appears for every dialogue line you write.
// example:
// [] This is a bucket.
//
// Notes:
// - Conversations, characters and sprites must me written as a single word.
// - Inside the brackets, there can be only 2 words and 1 space between them. Don't leave a space
// between the words and the brackets (ie. [ BOB sad ] will cause an error as there are 3 spaces)
// - You can skip lines everywhere you want, though I'd recommend to do that only when changing conversations 
// for readability (but that decision is up to you)
//
// That's basically it! As long as you follow the rules above, no error should come up.
// I tried to make it as intuitive as possible. I've also written a few test conversations
// so you can actually see what that looks like. Have fun writing!
